The JavaScript Full-Stack Bootcamp: LEVEL 24 VUE.JS (Lesson 114)

In this project we create a pixel drawing app using Vue as its foundation. This app is very similar to many other coloring apps now found on mobile devices. The three main components we create and utilize are a Pixel, Canvas, and ColorPicker.

This nice part about this simple app is that it leaves a lot of room for customization and future development.
